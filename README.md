# 100daysofML

Repository for python code and projects during my 100 days of ML learning. Updated regularly.

Day 1 - I was already enrolled in the udemy course, Tensorflow and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp on Udemy.
        Topic - Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction.

Day 2 - Autoencoders - Image reconstruction and cleaning.

Day 3 - GANs - What, Why and How to implement GANs for image generation.

Day 4 - ML Deployment using Flask HTML. I am more inclined towards using streamlit as it is easier to code and deploy.

Day 5 - Started the course - Master Computer Vision with OpenCV4.
        Reading / Writing images using openCV.
        Color spaces.

Day 6 - Image manipulation using Affine and non affine transformations.
        Image translations, rotations, scaling and resizing.

Day 7 - Arithmetics on Images and how it impacts the image output.
        Image masking, blurring, edge detection using canny.
        Project #1 - Sketch generator via webcam feed.

Day 8 - Image segmentation and contours

Day 9 - Approximating contours, matching shapes, finding convex contours

Day 10 - Finding lines, blob detection, Object detection intro (Small project to find the object in a image using Template Matching),
        Object matching using webcam using ORB matcher.

Day 11 - HOG (Histogram of Gradients), Using haarcascade classifiers for car, face, body in videos and live webcam feeds

Day 12 - Facial landmark detection, Project - Yawn detector, Written number classifier

Day 13 - Face recognition project

Day 14 - Object tracking, CAMShift and MeanShift tracking.

Day 15 - Start - Automatic number plate recognition, Computer Vision and deep learning, Digit recognition with CNN+OpenCV

These topics are part of the computer vision course I am going through. Cover a high level information.
Day 16 - Intro NN, Activation functions, Forward propagation, Loss functions, Steps for training  NN,
Back propagation and Gradient Descent, Regularization (L1[Lasso], L2[Ridge]), Cross Validation, Early Stopping, Dropout, Image/Data Augmentation, Epochs and batch sizes, Performance and Confusion matrix.

Day 17 - Convolution NN, Convolutions, Image features, convolution process, Depth, Stride and Padding, ReLu (max(o,x)), Pooling [Max / Average]        

Day 18 - Training a CNN using tensorflow on MNIST dataset, Train test splits on Image data, Cat vs dog classifier, Data augmentation for improving the model

Day 19 - OpenCV Course completed. Explainable Machine Learning using LIME.

Day 20 - Recurrent Neural networks from the book - Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow)

Day 21 - Time series data, seasonality, requirements for time series analysis, data restrictions, transforming data for time series analysis, use of the QQ plots for identifying the data distribution. Reinforcement Learning intro, Probability distributions, joint and conditional distribution
