        Reading / Writing images using openCV.
        Color spaces.

Day 6 - Image manipulation using Affine and non affine transformations.
        Image translations, rotations, scaling and resizing.

Day 7 - Arithmetics on Images and how it impacts the image output.
        Image masking, blurring, edge detection using canny.
        Project #1 - Sketch generator via webcam feed.

Day 8 - Image segmentation and contours

Day 9 - Approximating contours, matching shapes, finding convex contours

Day 10 - Finding lines, blob detection, Object detection intro (Small project to find the object in a image using Template Matching),
        Object matching using webcam using ORB matcher.

Day 11 - HOG (Histogram of Gradients), Using haarcascade classifiers for car, face, body in videos and live webcam feeds

Day 12 - Facial landmark detection, Project - Yawn detector, Written number classifier

Day 13 - Face recognition project

Day 14 - Object tracking, CAMShift and MeanShift tracking.

Day 15 - Start - Automatic number plate recognition, Computer Vision and deep learning, Digit recognition with CNN+OpenCV

These topics are part of the computer vision course I am going through. Cover a high level information.
