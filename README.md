# 100daysofML

Repository for python code and projects during my 100 days of ML learning. Updated regularly.

Day 1 - I was already enrolled in the udemy course, Tensorflow and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp on Udemy.
        Topic - Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction.

Day 2 - Autoencoders - Image reconstruction and cleaning.

Day 3 - GANs - What, Why and How to implement GANs for image generation.

Day 4 - ML Deployment using Flask HTML. I am more inclined towards using streamlit as it is easier to code and deploy.

Day 5 - Started the course - Master Computer Vision with OpenCV4.
        Reading / Writing images using openCV.
        Color spaces.

Day 6 - Image manipulation using Affine and non affine transformations.
        Image translations, rotations, scaling and resizing.

Day 7 - Arithmetics on Images and how it impacts the image output.
        Image masking, blurring, edge detection using canny.
        Project #1 - Sketch generator via webcam feed.

Day 8 - Image segmentation and contours

Day 9 - Approximating contours, matching shapes, finding convex contours

Day 10 - Finding lines, blob detection, Object detection intro (Small project to find the object in a image using Template Matching),
        Object matching using webcam using ORB matcher.

Day 11 - HOG (Histogram of Gradients), Using haarcascade classifiers for car, face, body in videos and live webcam feeds

Day 12 - Facial landmark detection, Project - Yawn detector, Written number classifier

Day 13 - Face recognition project
